A simple wrapper to read several data from your N26 bank account.

## What is N26?

> N26 (formerly known as Number26) is Europe's first bank account developed entirely for smartphones. With your N26 bank account, MasterCardÂ® and mobile app, you can conveniently transfer money from anywhere and keep track of your finances at all times. With MoneyBeam you're able to send money via sms or e-mail without the need to enter all the account details.
